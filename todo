Bugs/Internal:
- [*] pre-1582 ephemeris goes into an infinite loop
 - [ ] ephem can still go into infinite loops aroun 1582
- [ ] test cases where reasonable
- [ ] documentation and comments where reasonable
 - [ ] timestep
 - [ ] parse
 - [ ] output
 - [ ] query
 - [ ] value
Features:
- [*] Raw coordinates for stars/latlong
- [*] **Full** readme with examples
- [ ] Article on rust CLI astronomy
- [ ](?)  Anstyle formatted terminal tables
- [ ](?)  Smart width formatting for term ephemeris (i.e. not always 30 characters wide)
- [ ] Moar Calculations
 - [*](?) Binary Operators between objects (Angle Between, Distance between)
 - [*] Rise and set time properties
   - [ ] Do coordinate interpolation for {sun,moon}{rise,set}
 - [ ](?) add minor planets and other solar objects
 - [ ](?) Constellation bounds (i.e. "what constellation is this is")
 - [ ](?) Some Deep Space Probes? (Dynamic objects)
 - [ ](?) Moons for other planets?
 - [ ](?) Viewing from other objects (Which entails converting EVERYTHING into 3d coords)
