Bugs/Internal:
- [*] pre-1582 ephemeris goes into an infinite loop
- [*] more helpful error messages
- [*] split code up into multiple files
- [*] -l -L fail on uppercase N/S/E/W
- [ ] Southern Phase emojis
- [ ] test cases where reasonable
- [ ] documentation and comments where reasonable
- [ ] merge json printing and normal printing into one trait with alternate
- [ ] refactor vec property code
Features:
- [ ] Clap-related plumbing
  - [*] Help text
  - [ ] Make lat/long an option instead of default 0
    - [ ] Merge -l and -L into -l lat,long
    - [ ] latlong accept no suffix numbers
    - [ ] Error on lati > 90d
  - [*] Verify catalog objects and properties before runtime
    - [*] Un-CSV the property list
    - [*] Pre-parse and enumerate property names
- [ ] Ephemeris Generation and relative times
 - [ ] relative ephemeris start/end dates (i.e. -1w,1d,+1w)
 - [ ] Better Working Negative Time Steps (Maybe chrono can help?)
 - [ ] Negative checks in ephemeris generation
- [ ] Full readme with examples
- [ ] (?) JPL Ephemeris Format Output
- [ ] Shorten Distance Formatting
- [ ] Calculations
 - [ ] add minor planets and other solar objects
 - [ ] add stars (star catalog data where?)
 - [ ] Rise and set time properties
   - [ ] Find good sunrise/sunset algorithm
 - [ ] Binary Operators between objects (Angle Between, Distance between)
