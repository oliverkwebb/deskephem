Bugs/Internal:
- [*] pre-1582 ephemeris goes into an infinite loop
- [*] more helpful error messages
- [*] split code up into multiple files
- [*] -l -L fail on uppercase N/S/E/W
- [*] refactor vec property code
- [*] merge json printing and normal printing into one trait with alternate
- [*] Southern Phase emojis
- [ ] test cases where reasonable
- [ ] documentation and comments where reasonable
Features:
- [*] Ephemeris Generation and relative times
 - [*] relative ephemeris start/end dates (i.e. -1w,1d,+1w)
 - [*] Better Working Negative Time Steps (Maybe chrono can help?)
 - [*] Negative checks in ephemeris generation
- [*] Shorten Distance Formatting
- [*] Clap-related plumbing
  - [*] Help text
  - [*] Verify catalog objects and properties before runtime
    - [*] Un-CSV the property list
    - [*] Pre-parse and enumerate property names
  - [*] Make lat/long an option instead of default 0
    - [*] Merge -l and -L into -l lat,long
    - [*] latlong accept no suffix numbers
    - [*] Error on lati > 90d
- [ ] Full readme with examples
- [ ](?)  Anstyle formatted terminal tables
- [ ] Moar Calculations
 - [*] Rise and set time properties
 - [ ] Find good sunrise/sunset algorithm
 - [ ] add stars (star catalog data where?)
 - [ ] add minor planets and other solar objects
 - [ ] Binary Operators between objects (Angle Between, Distance between)
