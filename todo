Bugs/Internal:
- [*] pre-1582 ephemeris goes into an infinite loop
 - [ ] ephem can still go into infinite loops aroun 1582
- [ ] test cases where reasonable
- [ ] documentation and comments where reasonable
 - [ ] timestep
 - [ ] parse
 - [ ] output
 - [ ] query
 - [ ] value
Features:
- [ ] **Full** readme with examples
- [ ](?)  Anstyle formatted terminal tables
- [ ](?)  Smart width formatting for term ephemeris (i.e. not always 30 characters wide)
- [ ] Moar Calculations
 - [*] add stars from https://www.celestialprogramming.com/snippets/CommonStarNames.html
 - [*] Basic accounting for refraction
   - [*] Note: This is a nightmare for altitudes below the horizon: 1.02/tan(x+(10.3/x+5.11))
 - [*] Rise and set time properties
   - [ ] Do coordinate interpolation for {sun,moon}{rise,set}
 - [ ] Basic accounting for precession
   - [ ] Does this only matter for star data? The ephemeris stuff seems to handle it. Also NOT doing nutation
 - [ ] add minor planets and other solar objects
 - [ ] Binary Operators between objects (Angle Between, Distance between)
 - [ ] Constellation bounds (i.e. "what constellation is this is")
 - [ ](?) Some Deep Space Probes? (Dynamic objects)
 - [ ](?) Moons for other planets?
 - [ ](?) Viewing from other objects (Which entails converting EVERYTHING into 3d coords)
